1. A good place to start is to create a simple script which will accept some command line arguments and echo out some details about them (eg, how many are there, what is the secone one etc).

2. Create a script which will print a random word. There is a file containing a list of words on your system (usually /usr/share/dict/words or /usr/dict/words). Hint: Piping will be useful here.

3. Expand the previous activity so that if a number is supplied as the first command line argument then it will select from only words with that many characters. Hint: Grep may be useful here.

4. Take a copy of the two files script1.sh and script2.sh above then experiment by tweaking them and running them and observing the output. This will help you get a feel for how exporting variables works.

5. Now let's create a script which will take a filename as its first argument and create a dated copy of the file. eg. if our file was named file1.txt it would create a copy such as 2017-11-26_file1.txt. (To achieve this you will probably want to play with command substitution and the command date)

Challenge 1: To make it a bit harder, see if you can get it so that the date if after the name of the file (eg. file1_2017-11-26.txt (The command basename can be useful here.)

Challenge 2: Now see if you can expand the previous question to accept a list of files on the command line and it will create a named copy of all of them. (The command xargs may be useful here.)
